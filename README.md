2. Machine Learning for Credit Risk Prediction: A Systematic Literature Review - ["LINK"](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/11/169#)
   > This review explores the use of ML in credit risk prediction, highlighting the importance of AI in processing large datasets for financial institutions. It identifies common models, metrics, and challenges like explainability and data imbalance, while offering guidance for developing credit risk management tools to minimize defaults. Key variables include demographic, operational, and payment behavior data.
3. Advancing credit risk modeling with Machine Learning: A comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art - [LINK](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197624012405)
   > This reviews the use of ML in consumer credit risk modeling, emphasizing its growing importance in handling large datasets and improving predictive power compared to traditional methods like Logistic Regression (LR). While ML algorithms such as Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks (NN) offer potential enhancements, they face challenges in practical application. The review highlights the key steps in ML model development, from data pre-processing to parameter optimization, and stresses the need for standardized modeling procedures before deploying complex ML models commercially.
